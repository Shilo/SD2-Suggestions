## Crowdstorming
This system relies heavily on usage and reactions from the players and community of Soda Dungeon 2. The more this system is used, the more it will be noticed by the [Soda Dungeon 2 Developer](https://www.sodadungeon.com). I welcome everyone to use this system to get a more streamlined suggestion system going, and to get more attention towards community suggestions.
